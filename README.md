## 🎯 Overview

**EscrowFlow** is a production-ready Marlowe smart contract implementing a secure escrow system with integrated dispute resolution. Designed for Cardano blockchain, it automates payment holding, conditional release, and conflict resolution between transacting parties while minimizing trust requirements.

### **Key Value Propositions**
- 🛡️ **Secure Fund Custody** - Assets held in contract until explicit conditions met
- ⚖️ **Fair Dispute Resolution** - Three-tier resolution system with mediator arbitration
- ⏱️ **Time-Bound Processes** - Prevents indefinite fund locking with configurable deadlines
- 🔍 **Transparent Logic** - Verifiable on-chain execution with clear decision paths
- 🌐 **Permissionless Access** - No geographical restrictions or intermediary approvals

### **Core Components**
```haskell
-- ROLES
Role "Buyer"    -- Purchaser who deposits funds and receives goods/services
Role "Seller"   -- Provider who delivers goods/services and receives payment  
Role "Mediator" -- Neutral arbitrator for dispute resolution

-- TOKENS
Token "" ""     -- Native ADA (configurable for any Cardano native token)

-- TIME PARAMETERS (in slots, 1 slot ≈ 1 second)
ConstantParam "Price"                   -- Transaction value in Lovelace
TimeParam "Payment deadline"           -- Time to deposit funds
TimeParam "Complaint deadline"         -- Time for buyer inspection
TimeParam "Complaint response deadline"-- Time for seller response
TimeParam "Mediation deadline"         -- Time for mediator decision

-- CHOICE MAPPINGS
-- Buyer choices:      [0] = "Everything is alright", [1] = "Report problem"
-- Seller choices:     [0] = "Dispute problem", [1] = "Confirm problem"
-- Mediator choices:   [0] = "Dismiss claim", [1] = "Confirm problem"
✨ Features
🔒 Security & Trust Minimization
Non-custodial Design: Funds never held by intermediaries

Multi-party Verification: Requires explicit consent from involved parties

Deterministic Outcomes: Same inputs always produce same results

Immutable Logic: Contract terms cannot change after deployment

⚖️ Dispute Resolution Framework
Graduated Escalation: Direct negotiation → Mediation

Clear Jurisdiction: Well-defined roles and responsibilities

Time-bound Decisions: Prevents procedural delays

Balanced Incentives: Both parties have equal opportunity to present case

🔄 Operational Efficiency
Automated Execution: Eliminates manual escrow management

Reduced Counterparty Risk: Cryptographic guarantees replace trust

Global Accessibility: Operates 24/7 without geographical restrictions

Low Operational Cost: Minimal fees compared to traditional escrow services

TIMELINE (Example: 7-day transaction)
Day 0-1:   Payment deposit window
Day 1-4:   Delivery & inspection period  
Day 4-5:   Seller response period (if dispute)
Day 5-7:   Mediation period (if escalated)
Day 7:     Final resolution (all paths)

Marlowe Playground Simulation Steps
Initialize Contract

javascript
// Set parameters
const parameters = {
  Price: 10000000,
  "Payment deadline": 100,
  "Complaint deadline": 200,
  "Complaint response deadline": 250,
  "Mediation deadline": 300
};
Simulate Transactions

Advance to slot 50: Buyer deposits

Advance to slot 150: Buyer makes choice

Continue based on selected path

Validate Outcomes

Check final wallet balances

Verify contract state is "Closed"

Confirm all actions were valid

🛠️ Customization Options
Quick Modifications
Change Currency

haskell
-- From ADA to custom token
(Token "ASSET" "CS")  -- Replace with your currency/asset
Adjust Time Periods

haskell
-- For faster transactions (in slots)
TimeParam "Payment deadline": 3600        # 1 hour
TimeParam "Complaint deadline": 7200      # 2 hours
Add Partial Payments

haskell
-- Split into deposit and balance
Deposit ... (ConstantParam "DepositAmount")
-- Later payment
Pay ... (ConstantParam "FinalPayment")
Multiple Items/Services

haskell
-- Use Value map for multiple items
(AddValue (ConstantParam "Item1Price") 
          (ConstantParam "Item2Price"))
Advanced Extensions
A. Automated Oracle Integration
haskell
-- Add external data verification
(Case (Oracle (OracleId "DeliveryConfirmation") 
              [(Bound 1 1)]) 
      (Pay ...))
B. Multi-signature Requirements
haskell
-- Require multiple buyer approvals
(Both (Choice (ChoiceId "Approve" (Role "Buyer1")) [(Bound 1 1)])
      (Choice (ChoiceId "Approve" (Role "Buyer2")) [(Bound 1 1)]))
C. Progressive Payments
haskell
-- Multiple milestone payments
When [
  (Case (Choice (ChoiceId "Milestone1Complete" ...) ...)
        (Pay ... (DivValue (ConstantParam "Price") (Constant 3)))),
  ... Additional milestones
]
D. Insurance Pool Integration
haskell
-- Deduct insurance fee
(Let "InsuranceFee" (DivValue (ConstantParam "Price") (Constant 100))
     (Pay (Role "Buyer") (Role "InsurancePool") ...))
🔒 Security Considerations
Contract Security
Fund Safety

All assets held in script address, not personal wallets

Withdrawals require explicit contract authorization

No admin keys or backdoors

Logic Integrity

All execution paths predefined and verifiable

No unexpected state transitions

Formal verification possible through Marlowe semantics

Timing Attacks Prevention

Clear timeout boundaries

No last-minute manipulation opportunities

Predictable closure conditions

Operational Security
Key Management: Participants must secure their wallet keys

Parameter Validation: Verify all constants before deployment

Test Net Deployment: Always test with small amounts first

Monitoring: Track contract state through Cardano explorers

Risk Mitigation
yaml
Identified Risks:
  - Buyer never inspects: Add auto-release after extended period
  - Mediator unavailable: Implement backup mediator selection
  - Price volatility: Consider stablecoin integration
  - Contract bugs: Extensive testing and formal verification

// Web3 Integration Example
async function initiateEscrow(price, buyerAddress, sellerAddress) {
  const contract = await loadMarloweContract('EscrowFlow');
  const parameters = {
    Price: price * 1000000, // Convert to Lovelace
    "Payment deadline": calculateSlots(24, 'hours'),
    // ... other parameters
  };
  
  return await contract.deploy(parameters, {
    buyer: buyerAddress,
    seller: sellerAddress,
